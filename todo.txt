MUST:
- Implicit grant requires an redirect uri in the database (OAuth2ValidatorImpl#determineRedirectUri)

NICE:
- ClientResource and ResourceServerResource must debug log all activity
- The client in the authorization server should change the ui based on the granted scopes (no 'add/delete' in case of read only scope)
- add default scopes for clients that do not request any scope
