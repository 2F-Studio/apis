MUST:
- GUI finished
  - Add tooltips in the GUI for info about all the attributes
  - Style key/secret fields
  - Add Access Tokens readonly and delete views
- Documentation overall and README.md per submodule (especially surfconext-authn)
- Document how to extend the application (by overriding DefaultPackagesResourceConfig and Spring Configuration)
- rename the apis-example-resource-server-war module so that it cannot be confused with the apis-example-resource-server anymore.
- Release Spring-security-opensaml to get rid of snapshot dependency

NICE:
- ClientResource and ResourceServerResource must debug log all activity
- Document OAuth2Validator to explain or comply to spec compliance
- The client in the authorization server should ask for scopes (read, write) and based on the granted scopes the ui
  should be modified
- add default scopes for clients that do not request any scope
