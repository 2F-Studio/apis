MUST:
- GUI
- Documentation overall and README.md per submodule
- Implement refresh tokens (optional to configure for the client)
- Implement how to extend the application (by overriding DefaultPackagesResourceConfig and Spring Configuration)

SHOULD:
- Implement generic Map<String, String> attributes on the client - for extensibility
- Store the RolesPrincipal as serialized blob (http://stevedaskam.wordpress.com/2011/03/28/using-jpa-to-insert-and-retrieve-blobs-and-clobs/) for extensibility (the authentication plugin has a contract with the Resource Server) 
- Example client (using an example REST server)

NICE:
- Refactor VerifyResource and also use the OAuth2Validator here to validate and use the UserPassCredentials
- ClientResource and ResourceServerResource must debug log all activity
- TokenResource must use OAuth2Validator for validation
- Document OAuth2Validator to explain or comply to spec compliance
- Performance JMeter tests
- VM
