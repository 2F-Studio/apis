MUST:
- GUI finished
  - Add tooltips in the GUI for info about all the attributes
  - Style key/secret fields
- rename the apis-example-resource-server-war module so that it cannot be confused with the apis-example-resource-server anymore.
- Change GET access token response to limit included data (no sensitive client/resourceserver details)

NICE:
- ClientResource and ResourceServerResource must debug log all activity
- Document OAuth2Validator to explain or comply to spec compliance
- The client in the authorization server should change the ui based on the granted scopes (no 'add/delete' in case of read only scope)
- add default scopes for clients that do not request any scope
