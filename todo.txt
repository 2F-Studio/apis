MUST:
- Consistent scope between client = resource server force when updating scopes resource server (SERVER SIDE VALIDATION)
- GUI finished
	- Delete client and resource server need different -styled- confirmation
	- Remove $("a.copy-clipboard").zclip and do normal control copy by user
	- Add Access Tokens readonly and delete views
- Documentation overall and README.md per submodule (especially surfconext-authn)
- Document how to extend the application (by overriding DefaultPackagesResourceConfig and Spring Configuration)
- Refactor scopes and redirect-uri to seperate tables

NICE:
- ClientResource and ResourceServerResource must debug log all activity
- Document OAuth2Validator to explain or comply to spec compliance
