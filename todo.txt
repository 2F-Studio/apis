- JAX-RS provides for application bootstrapping in non-jaxrs-aware web containers. Dropwizard does not comply to this.
What type of bootstrapping should we adapt to?
https://cwiki.apache.org/WINK/jax-rs-getting-started.html

- consent (optional), are we going to deepen the dropwizard dependency and use views or use jsp, or freemarker java
- refrsh tokens (optional to configure for the client)

- rename VerifyResource and also use the OAuth2Validator here to validate and use the UserPassCredentials
- ClientResource and ResourceServerResource must debug log all activity
- TokenResource must use OAuth2Validator for validation
- Introduce a token generator and default implementation


- GUI
- Performance
- VM?
